# My Portfolio

A personal portfolio using HTML5 and CSS.

Work done:
- HTML contents on three pages: index.html, resume.html, bio.html
- CSS stylings for three pages: style.css
- A README file

Collaboration: All my own work

Hours spent: 5 hours

*Note: The main branch is set to the default branch only for this summer, since I already have another branch (gh-pages) hosting contents of another personal portfolio.*
