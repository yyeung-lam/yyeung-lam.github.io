    <div id="intro">
        <p>Hi, my name is <span class="name">Yeung</span>!</p>
    </div>
    <p>I am a post-bac student in computer science at Tufts University, wishing to become a master student next spring.
    I worked as a data scientist at an automation company, but decided to switch to software development so I came to Tufts CS this spring.
    My favorite data structure is <span class="name algo">monotonic stack/queue</span>.</p>
